I first heard about Rust a couple years ago, but I finally started looking at it a
week ago.  The narrative tutorials in the book were especially impressive.
As every step in the book "Just Worked" I grew more and more impressed, and felt confident
that I could at least bumble my way through borrow checker errors as I built something.
    
<img class="col two" src="/img/ferris.png" alt="" title="Ferris the crab"/>

<div class="col two caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
